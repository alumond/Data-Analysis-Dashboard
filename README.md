Data Analysis Dashboard Repository

Overview

This repository serves as a centralised archive for the data analysis dashboards I have created. It is intended to store, organise, and showcase dashboards developed across different projects, tools, and datasets.

The dashboards focus on transforming raw data into meaningful insights through visualisations, summary metrics, and analytical reporting.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to:

- Preserve completed dashboards for future reference
- Track progress and growth in data analysis and visualisation skills
- Showcase practical dashboard projects for learning and portfolio use

Contents

Each folder or file in this repository represents a standalone dashboard project and may include:

- Dashboard files (e.g., Power BI, Excel, Tableau, or Python-based dashboards)
- Supporting datasets (where applicable)
- Brief notes explaining the objective and insights of each dashboard

Tools and Technologies

Dashboards in this repository may be created using one or more of the following tools:

- Excel
- Power BI
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit)
- SQL
- Other data visualisation or analytics tools as applicable

Usage

This repository is primarily for documentation and portfolio purposes. Files can be explored to understand how different datasets were analyzed and visualized.

Notes

Datasets used may be publicly available, simulated, or anonymised for learning and demonstration purposes.

This repository will be updated regularly as new dashboards are created.
